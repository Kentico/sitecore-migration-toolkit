* The source of the migration data must be a Sitecore XM or XP instance, version 9.0 (Initial release) or newer.
* The tool runs in the context of a Sitecore application, therefore it should be deployed to a Sitecore CM or Standalone instance that has access to a database with the content you want to migrate.

### Target

* TBD

## Supported data and limitations
