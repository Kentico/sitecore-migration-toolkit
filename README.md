# Migration toolkit for Sitecore

The Universal Migration Toolkit for Sitecore automates data export from Sitecore to be imported into Xperience by Kentico.

## Prerequisites & Compatibility

### Source

* The source of the migration data must be a Sitecore XM or XP instance, version 9.0 (Initial Release) or newer.
* The tool runs in the context of a Sitecore application, therefore it should be deployed to a Sitecore CM or Standalone instance that has access to a database with the content you want to export.

### Installation

Follow the steps below to run the Universal Migration Toolkit for Sitecore:

1. Download the package from the repository [Releases]().
2. Install the package to your Sitecore instance by going to the **Control Panel** â†’ **Install a package** and following the installation wizard steps.
3. Configure the options in the `App_Config/Include/UMT/UMT.Sitecore.config` configuration file.
4. Navigate to the URL `/sitecore/UMT.aspx`.
5. Select a channel from the list, enter root paths and languages you would like to export. 
6. Optionally, select a media library and enter media folder paths you would like to export. Content and media exports can be created in one run or separately.
7. Click the button and wait for the process to run. Generated JSON files are stored in the folder `App_Data/UMT/` by default.
